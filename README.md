# Full-Stack Video Streaming Web App

Overview

Iâ€™ve developed a full-stack video streaming web app that combines functionality, performance, and a seamless user experience. Here's a quick overview of the tech stack and features:

Tech Stack

## Backend

### Built with Node.js, utilizing two separate servers for optimal performance:

- A REST API server for handling user authentication (login/signup), video uploads, and room management.

- A WebSocket server for enabling real-time chat functionality within streaming rooms.

## Frontend

- Created using React.js for a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure login and signup functionality.

- Video Uploading: Users can upload videos directly from the app.

- Room Creation: Users can create a room, select an uploaded video, and start streaming it.

- Join & Interact: Other users can join rooms to watch the video and engage through real-time chat.
